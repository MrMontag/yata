Yata -- Yet Another Tail Application

Building requirements:
- Qt 4.6 or later

- C++ compiler capable of building Qt (GNU gcc is recommended)

On Windows, the easiest way to build is to download the Qt SDK

To build on Linux:

Ensure yaml-cpp is built and installed in a standard place (/usr/lib or /usr/local/lib)

qmake
make

To build on Windows:

To run:
